npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

API routes can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/users](http://localhost:3000/api/users/login). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/users/login`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as API routes
